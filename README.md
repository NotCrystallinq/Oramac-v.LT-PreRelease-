# Oramac-v.LT-PreRelease-
this is the prerelease version of v.LT+ (its not v.1LT bcs i dont think ive added enough stuff yet

right well its the same as v.LT but with some new features. it has a clickGUI (which i accidently broke and now i cant make it work again) and a tabGUI (which i got bored of so it doesnt work either.

# keybinds and shit
(ive copy pasted directly from the code)

modules.add(new Sprint());
//key = "Q"

modules.add(new FullBright());
//key = "Z"

modules.add(new TabGUI());
//key = "\" (renders but not functional rn)

modules.add(new KillAura());
//key = "="

modules.add(new InventoryEscape());
//key = "M" (not working rn)

modules.add(new FastPlace());
//key = "B"

modules.add(new NoFall());
//key = "H"

modules.add(new XRay());
//key = "X" (not working rn)

modules.add(new Sneak());
//Key = "G"

modules.add(new Speed());
//Key = "Y"

modules.add(new AntiCobweb());
//Key = "2"

modules.add(new ClickGui());
//Key = "RShift" (renders but not functional rn)

modules.add(new Fly());
//Key = "J"

modules.add(new Fly_1LEpackage());
//Key = "K" (very hard to control once the speed builds up cos idk how to stop the drift but if u use a sword to block while ur turning then the sword will slow u down)
 
 all the blatant hacks have been unbound.
 
# how to use the hacks and commands
 to toggle on and off a module type ".t modulename" or ".toggle modulename"
 the bind hack will work tha same but it doesnt rn (someone is helping me fix it. idk anything abt how to code i do alot of guessing but its served me well so far)
 ".b modulename key" or ".bind modulename key"
 
 # resource packs  
 best used with this texture pack "https://minecraft-resourcepacks.com/download/war-v2-pvp/" or 
 "https://www.mediafire.com/file/cqrly6ccby98cbd/%C2%A78%21+%C2%A73Scope+%C2%A7832x+%C2%A77Revamp.zip" (not made by me) 
 because otherwise the text looks like shit.
 
# how to install
 how to install it if u cant read "https://youtu.be/bXm605_0fag" otherwise ---> To use the client unzip this folder
 and drag the folder that says Oramac v.LT (not the one that says "Oramac-v.LT-main") then type "%appdata% into the
 windows search bar and got to ".minecraft" and then drag and drop that file into the versions folder.
 
# current issues
 tab gui is functional killaura instabans on hypixel nofall instabans on hypixel inventory escape doesnt work xray doesnt work click gui doesnt work. speed will probably
 instaban on hypixel both flys will definetally instaban on hypixel anticobweb also probably instabans on hypixel.

reason for all the issues: Im super fucking lazy and cant be bothered like i literally just code this when ive got nothing better to do 
so dont expect any bypasses until v.ZL1 (for context thats 5 (actually 7) versions away and its taken me ages just to put out these two (now technically 3))
